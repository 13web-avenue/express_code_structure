#Express Code Structure

This project is an example of how to organize a medium-size express.js web application.

## What kind of app is this?

Web applications are not all the same, and there's not, in my opinion, a single code structure that should be applied to all express.js applications

## And what about Ruby on Rails?

It will be a theme throughout this project that many of the ideas embodied in Ruby on Rails, though widely accepted and used, are not actually very helpful and sometimes are the opposite of what this repository recommends.
